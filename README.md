## 🧭 Getting started

This repository is the home of Shopify's Standard Product Taxonomy. It houses the source-of-truth data, the distribution files for implementation, and the source code that makes this all sing.

We've structured it to be as user-friendly as possible, whether you're looking to integrate the taxonomy into your system, suggest changes, or delve into how it's developed and maintained.

### 🧩 How to integrate with the taxonomy

We're working on a variety of formats to make it easy to integrate with your systems. Today we have `txt` and `json` formats, and we're working on more. If you have a specific format you'd like to see, please open an issue and let us know!

### 🧑🏼‍🏫 How to make changes to the taxonomy or system

Dive straight into the [`main` branch](https://github.com/Shopify/product-taxonomy/tree/main) to modify the soure-of-truth data or the code that generates the taxonomy.

## 📅 Releases

You can always find the current published version in [`VERSION`](./VERSION). The changelog is available in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md).

While this is `UNSTABLE`, we're using SemVer, but when this goes stable it will transition to [CalVer](https://calver.org/), in sync with [Shopify's API release schedule](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/versioning#release-schedule).

That means a stable release every 3 months **at most**, at the beginning of the quarter. Version names are date-based to be meaningful and semantically unambiguous (for example, `2024-01`).
